# Multi-Platform E-Commerce Scraper - Version 2.0

## 1. Project Status & Overview

This project represents the **definitive enterprise-grade** version of the multi-platform scraper, completely refactored with cutting-edge anti-detection technologies and modern Python architecture. This version addresses all previous failures through advanced stealth mechanisms, comprehensive data validation, and a robust offline testing framework.

The core philosophy has evolved to **Undetectable, Validated, and Production-Ready**. The scraper now defeats modern bot-detection systems, validates all extracted data, and employs sophisticated multi-layered strategies for maximum success rates.

### **What's New in Version 7.0**

**Revolutionary Anti-Detection:**
- **Playwright-Stealth Integration:** Advanced browser fingerprint masking
- **Enhanced Browser Headers:** Modern sec-ch-ua and realistic fingerprinting
- **Intelligent Retry Logic:** Exponential backoff with smart error classification
- **Dynamic User-Agent Pools:** Latest browser versions with mobile/desktop variants

**Critical Parser Fixes:**
- **MercadoLibre Title Extraction:** Fixed to correctly extract from `img[title]` attributes
- **Enhanced Selector Robustness:** Multiple fallback selectors for all data points
- **Advanced Price Parsing:** Handles Colombian peso format and complex price structures
- **URL & ID Extraction:** Improved pattern matching for product identification

**Production-Grade Architecture:**
- **Modern Python Typing:** Complete type annotations throughout codebase
- **Comprehensive Data Validation:** Field-level validation with type checking
- **Modular Design:** Clear separation of concerns with maintainable code structure

**Current Functionality:**
-   **Multi-Platform:** Scrapes product data from Amazon.com and MercadoLibre with advanced parsing
-   **Stealth Evasion:** Integrates `playwright-stealth` with custom anti-detection scripts
-   **Resilient:** 5-layer strategy funnel with intelligent retry mechanisms and exponential backoff
-   **Self-Validating:** Comprehensive `unittest` framework with offline HTML testing
-   **Asynchronous:** High-performance async architecture with `httpx` and `playwright`
-   **Production-Ready:** Clean, typed codebase following modern Python best practices
-   **Comprehensive Logging:** Detailed execution logs with intelligent error reporting

## 2. Core Architecture: The 5-Layer Resilience Funnel

The scraper's intelligence lies in its strategy funnel. For every single page it needs to scrape, it follows this sequence, stopping as soon as it successfully retrieves valid data. This ensures maximum efficiency and respect for the target servers.



1.  **Cache First:** Checks a local `.cache` folder for recent results to avoid redundant requests and reduce server load.
2.  **API Request (MercadoLibre only):** Attempts to fetch clean JSON data directly from MercadoLibre's public API with proper error handling.
3.  **Enhanced Desktop HTTPX Request:** Makes sophisticated requests with modern browser headers (sec-ch-ua, sec-fetch-*) and intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff.
4.  **Mobile HTTPX Request:** Fallback mobile browser simulation with mobile-specific headers and user agents, often bypassing desktop-focused detection.
5.  **Advanced Stealth Browser Emulation:** Deploys `playwright-stealth` with custom anti-detection scripts, realistic viewport settings, and human-like delays to defeat sophisticated bot detection systems.

## 6. Running the Unit Tests

The comprehensive unit testing framework validates all parsing logic offline using static HTML files. This prevents silent failures and ensures scrapers work correctly when websites change.

### Run All Tests
```bash
python test_scrapers.py
```

### Run Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Test specific scraper
python -m unittest test_scrapers.TestAmazonScraper -v
python -m unittest test_scrapers.TestMercadoLibreScraper -v

# Test data validation
python -m unittest test_scrapers.TestDataValidation -v

# Test integration components
python -m unittest test_scrapers.TestScraperIntegration -v
```

### Test Coverage
The test suite covers:
- **HTML Parsing:** Validates extraction from realistic HTML structures
- **Data Validation:** Ensures all extracted data meets quality standards
- **Edge Cases:** Tests handling of missing prices, invalid data, CAPTCHA detection
- **Integration:** Validates caching, headers, user-agents, and retry mechanisms
- **Cross-Platform:** Tests both Amazon and MercadoLibre parsing logic

You should see output indicating all tests passed. Failed tests indicate website structure changes requiring selector updates.
